Android Bot is a simple interactive bot built using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. It features a cute Android-inspired character that responds to user interaction by raising its hands, blinking its eyes, and shaking its head.

## Features

- **Interactive Gestures**: Users can interact with the bot by clicking on arrows to perform various actions.
- **Dynamic Animation**: The bot's movements are animated using CSS and triggered by JavaScript events.
- **Responsive Design**: The bot's appearance adjusts to different screen sizes for a consistent user experience.

## Usage

To use the Android Bot, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. Once the page loads, you'll see the Android Bot character displayed on the screen.

- **Raise Left Hand**: Click on the left arrow button to raise the bot's left hand.
- **Raise Right Hand**: Click on the right arrow button to raise the bot's right hand.
- **Blink Eyes**: Click on the up arrow button to make the bot blink its eyes.
- **Shake Head**: The bot shakes its head automatically when it detects an incorrect user input.
